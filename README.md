# Codewars Solutions
## by Willinlondon

Being a Codewars enthusiast, I have resisted the urge to use an IDE for a while now when solving katas, but as they have gotten harder and more complex, I have finally caved in and starting using Intellij to help me solve my Kotlin challenges at least.

The good news is that this allows me to upload and keep track of my solutions here. Feel free to compare, but I strongly urge you to complete any kata before looking at solutions online!
